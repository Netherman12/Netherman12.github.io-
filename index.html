    <h2 id="usage-of-links">How links are used</h2>
    <p>Links are used to get from one page to another.<br>
       
           Links are really useful when you have to get pages that you usually type a lot. <br> 
           It can be a pain for the user just making them type. <br>          That's why we should add links and internal links to our webpages. 
           
       </p>
    <h2>How links are made</h2>
    <p id="links-are-made">
        Links are (obviously) made in HTML. <br> 
        When we add a link to our webpage it allows the user to do so much, they can go to different pages, do stuff on those pages, and with internal links they can go to different parts of your webpage!
